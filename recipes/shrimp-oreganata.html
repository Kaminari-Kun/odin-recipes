        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Definitely use very large shrimp for this shrimp oreganata recipe.
          Think shrimp scampi meets a crunchy baked Parmesan topping. You can
          serve them as an appetizer, on top of cooked pasta with extra
          lemon-butter sauce, or simply with some grilled bread and flavorful
          olive oil to dip in.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>
              Fill a separate saucepan with lightly salted water and bring to a
              boil. Add the macaroni and cook until tender, about 8 minutes.
              Drain.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Peel shrimp, leaving tails intact.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>
              Use a paring knife to cut lengthwise down vein side of shrimp,
              cutting almost but not all the way through the shrimp. Remove the
              vein and gently press shrimp apart to butterfly it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>
              Combine shrimp, wine, olive oil, salt, 1 tablespoon parsley, 1
              tablespoon garlic, 1 teaspoon lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon crushed
              red pepper in a bowl; toss to coat shrimp evenly. Let stand at
              room temperature for at least 10 minutes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, combine panko, Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons melted
              butter, and remaining 1 tablespoon parsley, 1 tablespoon garlic, 1
              teaspoon lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper in a
              small bowl; stir until well blended.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 7</h4>
            <p>
              Remove shrimp from marinade and place, cut side up, about 2 inches
              apart on the prepared baking sheet. Top each shrimp with about 2
              teaspoons panko mixture, pressing lightly to adhere.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 8</h4>
            <p>
              Bake in the preheated oven until shrimp are cooked through, 8 to
              10 minutes. Without opening oven, switch oven to broil. Broil
              until topping is golden brown and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 9</h4>
            <p>
              Transfer shrimp to a platter. Stir together lemon juice, remaining
              1 tablespoon melted butter and any accumulated juices from the
              baking sheet in a small bowl; drizzle evenly over shrimp on
              platter and garnish with parsley. Serve hot with lemon wedges.
