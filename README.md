This is a HTML project for "The Odin Project".
I learned HTML watching "Elzero Web School" videos, Thanks to MR. Osama Mohamed for his time to make great free tutorials.
I found the Odin Project when surfing the internet and I found it a great idea to practice what I have learned and learn new things to become a MERN stack dev.
